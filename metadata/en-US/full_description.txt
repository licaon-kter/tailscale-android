Tailscale is a mesh VPN alternative that makes it easy to connect your devices, wherever they are. No more fighting configuration or firewall ports. Built on WireGuard®, Tailscale enables an incremental shift to zero-trust networking by implementing “always-on” remote access. This guarantees a consistent, portable, and secure experience independent of physical location.

F-Droid Anti-Features:
* NonFreeNet - uses a non-free network service which is impossible, or not easy to replace without rebuilding the app
* Tracking - Tailscale reports logging information to our central logging server that is used to provide support, troubleshooting, and administrative features. <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1011/log-mesh-traffic/#opting-out-of-client-logging">Client logs can be disabled on some platforms</a>, but not yet Android. For more information on what information is logged and how it is used, see <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1011/log-mesh-traffic/">an explanation of logs</a> and <a href="https://tailscale.com/privacy-policy/#the-information-we-collect">Tailscale's privacy policy</a>.
